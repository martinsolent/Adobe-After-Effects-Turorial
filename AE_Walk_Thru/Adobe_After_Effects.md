## Add Asset from Project Panel to a Timeline location

or press S on keyboard and use drag over the Scale percentage values in timeline.

## Timeline Layer Structure
Add 3 shapes to Composition. Make sure you do not have shape selected before adding new shape as it will be placed on the selected layer not a new one.

Add a colour label, change their time length and show/hide layer

## Layer Time Stretch
 You can increase or decrease the length of a layer block:
 
 Layer > Time > Time Stretch

## Animate - Move
Create a shape and make it 10secs in the Timeline - either Drag it with the mouse or Stretch Time as above.

You might need to move centre point to the centre of the shape as above. Do this BEFORE YOU ADD KEYFRAMES
 
Press P on the Keyboard to bring up Positioning in the Timeline.

## Adding Solid (Colour Filled Layers)
Right Mouse in Project Panel Import > Solid

![](AE_IMAGES/right_mouse_new_solid.png)

Adjust settings in the Solid dialogue panel and click OK

![](AE_IMAGES/solid_panel.png)

Solid will appear in Project Panel - Drag and Drop to your Composition

![](AE_IMAGES/drag_solid_to_comp.png)

You can open the solid dialogue panel from the layer menu to edit it

![](AE_IMAGES/solid_settings_menu.png)

## Correct Curved Path Between Keyframes

![](AE_IMAGES/first_path.png)

You might find that after you have made an initial straight motion path (above) between keyframes the next keyframe will have a curved path (below)

![](AE_IMAGES/curved_path.png)

Select the Convert Vertex Tool From the Pen Tools 

![](AE_IMAGES/convert_tool.png)

and click the path to convert to a straight path.

![](AE_IMAGES/straight_path.jpg)

## Object Following the Path (Banking)

To create more realistic path follow use the Auto-Orient from the layer menu.

![](AE_IMAGES/auto_or.png)

## Add and Edit Sound
Just drag and drop a sound file either MP3 or WAV onto the Project Panel then drag and drop onto the timeline. You can crop sound in the timeline by using keyboard short cut:  **Command Shift D** (APPLE MAC) or **Control Shift D** (WINDOWS), but Ideally it is best to edit sound to the right length before you bring it into After Affects.
